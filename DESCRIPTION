Title: Connected Components of an Undirected Graph
Version: 1.0
Author: Stéphane Laurent
Maintainer: Stéphane Laurent <laurent_step@outlook.fr>
Description: Provides a function for fast computation of the connected components of an undirected graph (though not faster than the 'components' function of the 'igraph' package) from the edges or the adjacency matrix of the graph. Based on this one, a function to compute the connected components of a triangle 'rgl' mesh is also provided.
