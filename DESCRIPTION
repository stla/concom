Description: Provides a function for fast computation of the connected
    components of an undirected graph (though not faster than the
    components() function of the 'igraph' package) from the edges or the
    adjacency matrix of the graph. Based on this one, a function to
    compute the connected components of a triangle 'rgl' mesh is also
    provided.
